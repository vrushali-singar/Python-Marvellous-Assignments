## 📌 Programs List

### 1. ✅ Vowel or Consonant Check
- Accepts a single character from the user and checks if it's a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or consonant.
- Handles invalid inputs (e.g., numbers or special characters).
- Includes two methods: using `if` conditions and `for` loop.

### 2. ✅ Count Vowels in a String
- Accepts a string and counts how many vowels are present in it.
- Uses a function and `for` loop to process the string.

### 3. ✅ Voting Eligibility Checker
- Accepts age as input and checks whether the person is eligible to vote (18+).
- Validates the input for negative or zero age.

### 4. ✅ Largest Among Three Numbers
- Accepts three numbers from the user.
- Uses nested `if-else` statements to find the largest number.

### 5. ✅ Even or Odd Number Check
- Accepts a number and checks if it is even or odd.
- Special case handled for 0.

### 6. ✅ Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter
- Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula:  
  `F = (C × 9/5) + 32`

### 7. ✅ Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle
- Accepts length and width as input (float).
- Calculates and prints:
  - **Area** = `length × width`
  - **Perimeter** = `2 × (length + width)`
